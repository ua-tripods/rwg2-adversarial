Try adversarial with logistic regression instead (multilass)
Now it's a convex problem so we can apply Principle Geodesic Analysis
(wasserstein distance)

optimal transport transform space adversarial example keaton

L2 optimization 

write up what a good solution (adversarial example)

upscaling with linear interpolation (blinear) use cubic instead hermit
filter

Image Magic converg-filter(hermit)-ressize(200%)-image sharpen (deblur)
pillow (python)


summarize the variances
rating how hard the problem was to solve

reduce data to 14x14 train a new network and analyze the varainces of
the adversarial attack

dataset vector graphics (ucirvine)


don't break on first misclassicication. use threshold on loss

setup statistics dropbox and email with Mohammed and 

use L2 instead of cross-entropy loss for the adversarial search

implement logging for python code.
